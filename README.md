Matan Georgi

This is the Back end for the project.\
I have written this backend server using Django.

# How to run:
### `cd Covid19_Backend`
### `python manage.py runserver`

Make sure to change to the inner directory before the runserver command.\
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/


# How to connect to PostgreSQL:
Inside the directory covid19_backend there is a file name settings.py.\
in this file there is variable called DATABASES, you should change the information\
in order to sync to your db.
